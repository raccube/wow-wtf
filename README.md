# raccube's WoW UI

1. Place the account directory in your client's WTF directory
2. Rename the account directory to correspond to your account name (if you've started playing WoW after the move to Battle.net this will be some numbers)


I stopped playing WoW after Shadowlands made me realise I've been on copium since 2018. This repo is an archive of my WTF directory.
